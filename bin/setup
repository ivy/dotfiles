Warning: mise was not found in PATH.

This project uses mise to manage its developer tools.

Using mise is optional. You can run `bin/test` and `chezmoi` yourself,
but you will need to install required dependencies on your own.

- For hints, read `.mise.toml`.
- For a fully self-contained environment, use Dev Containers (VS Code / Cursor).
