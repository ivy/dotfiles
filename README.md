# Dotfiles Redux

This repository contains my personal dotfiles for setting up a productive developer environment on macOS, Linux, and containerized setups using [Devcontainers](https://containers.dev/). The goal is to provide a stable and maintainable environment that prioritizes pragmatic defaults over heavy customization.

## Philosophy

- **Pragmatism**: I prefer tools and configurations that are stable, well supported, and widely adopted. Instead of tinkering with bleeding-edge setups, I rely on curated collections such as Oh My Zsh and "sensible" defaults for various applications.
- **Portability**: These dotfiles should work across macOS and Linux machines, as well as within containers. They are designed to be reliable whether installed system-wide or through a Devcontainer configuration.
- **Consistency**: The configuration aims to make pairing with others easy by sticking to intuitive shortcuts and well-known conventions. While these dotfiles improve my workflow, I can still work effectively without them if necessary.
- **Reliability over Performance**: Start-up speed is less important than ensuring things always work. Runtime performance should not be significantly degraded by these configurations.

## Goals

1. **Stable setup** that rarely fails and is simple to maintain.
2. **Easy installation** on a fresh Mac or Linux system, with support for Devcontainers for containerized development.
3. **Shared tools** that follow common standards, enabling me to collaborate with others without friction.
4. **Documentation** that clearly explains the rationale behind each configuration choice.
