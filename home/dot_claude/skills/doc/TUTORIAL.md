# Tutorials - Learning-Oriented Documentation

A tutorial is a **lesson** that takes a student through a learning experience under the guidance of a tutor. Tutorials are **learning-oriented**.

## Core Purpose

- Help the learner **acquire basic competence**
- Provide a **learning experience** through doing
- Build **confidence** in the learner
- Serve the user's **study**, not their work

## The Teacher-Student Contract

| Responsibility | Owner |
|----------------|-------|
| What the student learns | Teacher |
| What the student does | Teacher |
| Student's success | Teacher |
| Following directions | Student |

The student is NOT responsible for learning, understanding, or remembering. That burden falls on the tutorial author.

## Key Principles

### 1. Don't Try to Teach

Provide experiences that allow learning to happen. Don't explain - let them discover through doing.

**Anti-pattern:** Long explanations of concepts before exercises.
**Pattern:** Minimal context, then immediately doing something.

### 2. Show Where They're Going

Tell the learner upfront what they'll accomplish:

> "In this tutorial, we will create and deploy a scalable web application."

**NOT:**

> "In this tutorial you will learn..." (presumptuous)

### 3. Deliver Results Early and Often

Every step should produce a **visible, meaningful result**. Small wins build confidence.

### 4. Maintain a Narrative of Expected

- "You will notice that..."
- "After a few moments, the server responds with..."
- Show exact expected output
- Flag likely signs of going wrong

### 5. Point Out What to Notice

Close learning loops by highlighting environmental signs:
- How prompts change
- What output indicates success
- Subtle details they might miss

### 6. Target the Feeling of Doing

Create a flow state where purpose, action, thinking, and result join together. This feeling becomes pleasure and drives skill development.

### 7. Encourage Repetition

Make steps repeatable. Learners gain confidence by seeing the same result happen again.

### 8. Ruthlessly Minimize Explanation

> "We're using HTTPS because it's more secure."

That's enough. Link to detailed explanation elsewhere. Explanation breaks the spell of learning.

### 9. Focus on the Concrete

- *This* problem
- *This* action
- *This* result

General patterns emerge from concrete examples naturally.

### 10. Ignore Options and Alternatives

One path. No diversions. Everything else can wait.

### 11. Aspire to Perfect Reliability

The tutorial must work for every user, every time. A learner who doesn't get expected results loses confidence in the tutorial, the product, and themselves.

## Tutorial Characteristics

| Aspect | Tutorial Approach |
|--------|-------------------|
| Environment | Contrived, safe, controlled |
| Path | Single line, no choices |
| Responsibility | Teacher bears all risk |
| Competence assumed | None |
| Scope | Concrete and particular |
| Skills taught | General principles |
| Unexpected events | Eliminated |

## Language Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| First-person plural | "We will create..." |
| State what they'll accomplish | "In this tutorial, we will..." |
| Clear imperatives | "First, do x. Now, do y." |
| Minimal explanation | "We must do x before y because... (see Explanation)" |
| Set expectations | "The output should look something like..." |
| Provide orientation | "Notice that... Remember that... Let's check..." |
| Celebrate completion | "You have built a secure three-layer engine..." |

## What Tutorials Are NOT

- **Not how-to guides** - those serve work, not study
- **Not basic vs advanced** distinction - tutorials can cover advanced topics
- **Not reference** - no comprehensive option lists
- **Not explanation** - minimal "why"

## Tutorial vs How-to Guide

| Aspect | Tutorial | How-to Guide |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Purpose | Help acquire competence | Help accomplish a task |
| User mode | Study | Work |
| Path | Managed, controlled | Real-world, anything can happen |
| Assumptions | User knows nothing | User is already competent |
| Environment | Contrived | Real |
| Choices | None | Forks and branches |
| Safety | Guaranteed | Cannot be promised |
| Responsibility | Teacher | User |

## The Cooking Analogy

Teaching a child to cook:
- It doesn't matter what they make or how correctly
- Success is what the child **gains**, not what they **produce**
- They learn by working alongside you, through activities, not from what you say
- If attention wanes, end early - any small achievement is progress

## Testing Your Tutorial

- Does every step produce a visible result?
- Can a complete beginner follow it?
- Is explanation minimized?
- Is there exactly one path?
- Does it build confidence?
- Is it reliable (works every time)?
