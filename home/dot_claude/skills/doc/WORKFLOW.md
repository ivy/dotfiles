# Diátaxis Workflow

How to apply Diátaxis in practice through iterative improvement.

## Core Philosophy

Diátaxis prescribes an approach that runs **counter to accepted wisdom**:
- Discourages planning and top-down workflows
- Prefers small, responsive iterations
- Overall patterns emerge from within

## Use as a Guide, Not a Plan

Diátaxis is a **map**, not a **plan**.

It helps you:
- Check you're in the right place
- Know you're going in the right direction
- Think about and understand your documentation
- Identify problems
- Judge what to do

It does NOT:
- Require completing a structure
- Demand four divisions in your hierarchy

## Don't Worry About Structure

**Using Diátaxis means NOT spending energy on structure.**

If you follow Diátaxis prompts, structure emerges because documentation improves. Structure is an **outcome** of good practice, not a cause.

### What NOT to Do

Do NOT create empty structures:
```
docs/
├── tutorials/      (empty)
├── how-to-guides/  (empty)
├── reference/      (empty)
└── explanation/    (empty)
```

This is horrible. Don't do it.

### What to Do

Make changes where you see opportunities. At some point, changes will **demand** reorganization. That's when structure forms - from the inside.

## The Iterative Workflow

### Step 1: Choose Something

**Any** piece of documentation. Don't go looking for problems.

Options:
- The file you're in right now
- The last page you read
- Something chosen at random

### Step 2: Assess It

Consider it critically. Prefer small things:
- A paragraph
- A sentence
- A section

Challenge it with questions:
- What user need does this represent?
- How well does it serve that need?
- What can be added, moved, removed, changed?
- Does language and logic meet this doc type's requirements?

### Step 3: Decide What to Do

Based on your assessment:
- What **single next action** will produce an **immediate improvement**?

### Step 4: Do It

Complete that single action.
**Consider it completed** - publish it or commit the change.

Don't feel you need to do more to make a worthy improvement.

### Step 5: Repeat

Go back to Step 1.

## Why This Works

- Reduces stress of "what to do"
- Keeps work flowing in the right direction
- No plan needed
- Every step is progress
- Small changes compound

## Organic Growth Model

### Well-Formed Growth

Good documentation grows like a healthy organism:
- Structure develops at the cellular level
- Overall structure emerges from healthy cell development
- Not imposed from above or outside
- Built from the inside-out, one cell at a time

### Complete, Not Finished

Like a plant:
- **Never finished** - always can develop further
- **Always complete** - nothing missing for current stage

Documentation is:
- Never finished (adapts to product and user needs)
- Always complete (useful, appropriate, healthy)

## Anti-Patterns

### Planning Everything First

**Problem:** Trying to design the perfect structure before writing
**Reality:** You can't know the right structure until you have content

### Big Bang Restructuring

**Problem:** Tearing everything down to start fresh
**Reality:** Incremental improvement is safer and more effective

### Waiting for Substantial Changes

**Problem:** Wanting big tranches before publishing
**Reality:** Every step in the right direction is worth publishing immediately

### Working on the Big Picture

**Problem:** Trying to solve everything at once
**Reality:** Diátaxis guides small steps; keep taking them

## Practical Tips

### When Starting Fresh

1. Write the content you need most urgently
2. Apply Diátaxis principles to that content
3. Structure will emerge as you add more

### When Improving Existing Docs

1. Pick any page
2. Ask: does this serve its stated purpose?
3. Make one improvement
4. Move on

### When Reorganizing

Wait until:
- You have enough content to see patterns
- The content itself demands reorganization
- Users are having trouble finding things

Then:
- Let the content guide the structure
- Don't force content into predetermined boxes

## Signals to Recognize

### Good Signs

- Easy to answer "what type is this?"
- Content matches its type
- Users find what they need
- Clear boundaries between types

### Warning Signs

- "This is kind of a tutorial/how-to hybrid"
- Explanation scattered throughout reference
- Tutorials that assume competence
- How-to guides that teach concepts

### Time to Restructure

- Content clearly wants to be somewhere else
- Users consistently look in wrong places
- You're fighting the structure to add content

## Workflow Checklist

For each piece of documentation:

- [ ] Identify what user need it serves
- [ ] Check it matches the appropriate doc type
- [ ] Assess if it serves that need well
- [ ] Find one thing to improve
- [ ] Make the improvement
- [ ] Publish/commit immediately
