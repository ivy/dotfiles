# Documentation Quality

Diátaxis addresses **deep quality** in documentation, which is distinct from functional quality.

## Two Types of Quality

### Functional Quality

Objectively measurable standards:
- **Accuracy** - conforms to reality
- **Completeness** - covers everything
- **Consistency** - uniform throughout
- **Usefulness** - serves a purpose
- **Precision** - exact and specific

**Characteristics:**
- Independent of each other (can be accurate but incomplete)
- Measurable (often with numbers)
- Objective (belongs to the world)
- Represents constraints (tests you might fail)

**Impact of lapses:** Immediately apparent to users.

### Deep Quality

Subjective characteristics:
- **Feels good to use**
- **Has flow**
- **Fits human needs**
- **Is beautiful**
- **Anticipates the user**

**Characteristics:**
- Interdependent (tangled together)
- Only judgable, not measurable
- Subjective (assessed against human needs)
- Conditional upon functional quality
- Represents liberation (work of creativity)

## The Relationship

```
Deep quality requires functional quality
        ↓
But functional quality doesn't guarantee deep quality
```

Documentation can be:
- Accurate, complete, consistent... and still awkward and unpleasant to use
- Useful... but lacking flow

Documentation cannot be:
- Beautiful while also inaccurate
- Anticipating needs while also inconsistent

## The Clothing Analogy

### Functional Quality
- Keeps you warm and dry
- Stands up to wear
- Measurable, obvious

### Deep Quality
- Hangs well
- Moves well
- Expertly shaped
- Quality of materials and workmanship

You need expertise to recognize *what* makes clothing excellent.
But anyone recognizes *that* it's excellent because **it feels good to wear**.

## How Users Experience Quality

Users may not be able to say *why* documentation is good, but they know *that* it is good.

It **feels good**:
- Pleasure and satisfaction when using it
- It fits and moves with you
- Flow from one task to the next

## What Diátaxis Addresses

Diátaxis **cannot address functional quality**. It cannot make documentation accurate or complete.

But Diátaxis **can expose lapses** in functional quality:
- Mirroring code structure reveals gaps
- Moving explanation out of tutorials highlights missing guidance

Diátaxis **can create deep quality**:
- Fits user needs (categories based on needs)
- Preserves flow (prevents rhythm disruption)
- Proper organization and arrangement

## Understanding the Limits

Diátaxis offers **principles**, not a formula.

It cannot:
- Make documentation beautiful by itself
- Replace UX/UI design skills
- Guarantee deep quality
- Be a short-cut to success

It can:
- Lay down conditions for the **possibility** of deep quality
- Help you think effectively about your work

## Pursuing Quality

### For Functional Quality
- Conscientious observance of craft demands
- Solid technical skill
- Knowledge of the domain
- Ability to create coherent, consistent maps

### For Deep Quality
- Apply Diátaxis principles consistently
- Pay attention to user needs
- Maintain proper doc organization
- Preserve flow
- Consider form and language for each doc type

## Quality Checklist

### Functional Quality

- [ ] Accurate (matches reality)
- [ ] Complete (no gaps)
- [ ] Consistent (same patterns throughout)
- [ ] Useful (serves a purpose)
- [ ] Precise (exact, not vague)

### Deep Quality (via Diátaxis)

- [ ] Fits user needs (correct doc type for situation)
- [ ] Has flow (smooth progress, no jarring transitions)
- [ ] Boundaries maintained (types don't bleed into each other)
- [ ] Proper language (matches doc type requirements)
- [ ] Appropriate structure (mirrors subject or user journey)
