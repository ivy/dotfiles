# The Diátaxis Compass

A decision tool for determining documentation type when intuition fails.

## The Problem

The Diátaxis map shows the relationship between doc types, but:
- Intuition isn't always reliable
- Sometimes intuition gives wrong answers quickly
- Authors often ask: "What form of documentation is this?"

The compass reduces a complex 2D problem to simpler parts.

## The Compass

| If the content... | ...and serves the user's... | ...then it belongs to... |
|-------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| informs **action** | **acquisition** of skill | **Tutorial** |
| informs **action** | **application** of skill | **How-to Guide** |
| informs **cognition** | **application** of skill | **Reference** |
| informs **cognition** | **acquisition** of skill | **Explanation** |

## Using the Compass

Ask just two questions:
1. **Action or cognition?**
2. **Acquisition or application?**

The intersection gives your answer.

## Flexible Terms

Use these terms flexibly when finding your bearings:

| Term | Also means |
|------|------------|
| Action | Practical steps, doing |
| Cognition | Theoretical/propositional knowledge, thinking |
| Acquisition | Study, learning |
| Application | Work, using |

## Different Question Forms

Apply the compass in multiple ways:

- Do I think I am writing for *x* or *y*?
- Is this writing in front of me engaged in *x* or *y*?
- Does the user need *x* or *y*?
- Do I want to *x* or *y*?

## Different Scopes

Apply close-up or from a distance:
- At the level of **sentences and words**
- At the level of **paragraphs**
- Considering an **entire document**

## When to Use the Compass

Most effective when:
- You *think* you know what you're doing but feel doubt
- You're having difficulty with the work
- Something feels "off" about the documentation

The compass forces you to stop and reconsider.

## Decision Tree

```
Start here: What is the primary purpose of this content?

Is it about DOING something (action)?
├── YES: Does it serve learning or getting work done?
│   ├── Learning (acquisition) → TUTORIAL
│   └── Getting work done (application) → HOW-TO GUIDE
│
└── NO (it's about knowing/understanding - cognition):
    Does it serve learning or getting work done?
    ├── Getting work done (application) → REFERENCE
    └── Learning (acquisition) → EXPLANATION
```

## Quick Tests

### Test 1: Where would you read this?

| Reading location | Likely doc type |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Following along, doing things | Tutorial or How-to |
| At the keyboard, looking something up | Reference |
| In the bath, away from work | Explanation |

### Test 2: What question does it answer?

| Question pattern | Doc type |
|------------------|----------|
| "Can you teach me to...?" | Tutorial |
| "How do I...?" | How-to Guide |
| "What is...?" | Reference |
| "Why...?" | Explanation |

### Test 3: What user state does it serve?

| User state | Doc type |
|------------|----------|
| Beginner learning | Tutorial |
| Competent user working | How-to or Reference |
| User reflecting/studying | Explanation |

## Common Misidentifications

### Looks like Tutorial, is actually How-to

**Symptom:** "Getting Started" guide that assumes competence
**Fix:** If user is expected to adapt to their situation → How-to

### Looks like Reference, is actually Explanation

**Symptom:** Reference with long "why" discussions
**Fix:** Move discussion to Explanation, keep Reference austere

### Looks like How-to, is actually Tutorial

**Symptom:** How-to that teaches concepts along the way
**Fix:** If goal is learning → Tutorial; if goal is task completion → How-to

### Looks like Explanation, is actually Reference

**Symptom:** Explanation that's really just listing facts
**Fix:** If it's facts about the machinery → Reference

## The Map for Context

The compass works with the map:

```
                    ACQUISITION          APPLICATION
                    (study)              (work)
                    ─────────────────────────────────
        ACTION      │ Tutorial     │   How-to Guide │
        (doing)     │              │                │
                    ├──────────────┼────────────────┤
        COGNITION   │ Explanation  │   Reference    │
        (knowing)   │              │                │
                    ─────────────────────────────────
```

The compass is the decision tool. The map shows relationships.
