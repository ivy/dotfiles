# Create Pull Request

Opens a pull request in the browser for final review and submission.

## Arguments

```
[additional context]
```

Optional context to incorporate into the PR description - details not covered in commits, important considerations, areas needing attention, or anything to emphasize for reviewers.

## Instructions

### 1. Check for PR Template

Search for templates in order of precedence:

```
.github/pull_request_template.md
.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*.md
pull_request_template.md
PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*.md
docs/pull_request_template.md
docs/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*.md
```

If multiple templates exist in a `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/` directory, list them and ask which to use.

### 2. Gather Context

Run in parallel:
- `git status` - check for uncommitted changes
- `git log --oneline @{upstream}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git log --oneline -10` - commits to include
- `git diff --stat @{upstream}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || git diff --stat HEAD~5..HEAD` - files changed

If there are staged changes ready to commit, ask whether to commit first or proceed.
If there are only untracked files (not relevant to the PR), proceed without asking.

### 3. Draft PR Content

**Title:** Derive from branch name or commits. Use conventional format if repo follows it.

**Body:** If template found, fill it in. Otherwise use:

```markdown
## Why

[Problem/motivation - 1-3 sentences]

## What

[Approach - brief, not a code walkthrough]

## Notes for reviewers

[Non-obvious decisions, areas of uncertainty, or "looks wrong but isn't" explanations]

---

🤖 [Conversation log](GIST_URL)
```

If user provided additional context in arguments, incorporate it appropriately into the PR body.

Draft the content but don't show it to the user for approval - proceed directly to creation.

### 3.1 Export Conversation Log and Create Gist

Export **only the current session** and pipe directly to a secret Gist:

```bash
~/.claude/skills/pr/claude-extract-session "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}" \
  | gh gist create --filename "pr-conversation-<branch-name>.md" -
```

The shim:
- Takes the current session ID (provided by the `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` substitution)
- Extracts **only that session** with `--detailed` output
- Writes markdown to stdout (no files created on disk)
- Pipes directly to `gh gist create` (secret by default)

Capture the Gist URL from the output and include it in the PR body after the horizontal rule.

### 4. Push and Create PR

**Push first:** If the branch hasn't been pushed or is behind:
```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

**Then create PR using the shim:**

Default command:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/pr/gh-pr-create-web --title "..." --body "..."
```

With template file:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/pr/gh-pr-create-web --template ".github/pull_request_template.md"
```

The shim enforces `--web` flag, ensuring PRs open in browser for human review.

### 5. Report Result

Simply note that the PR creation command was executed. The browser will open automatically for final review.

## Examples

```
/pr                                           → Standard PR, opens browser
/pr This needs careful review of the DB migrations → Emphasizes DB migration review
/pr The API changes are breaking but documented    → Highlights breaking changes
```

## Edge Cases

- **No upstream:** Ask for base branch
- **Empty diff:** Warn and confirm before creating empty PR
- **Draft PR:** If user mentions "draft" or "WIP", add `--draft` flag
- **Multiple templates:** List options, ask which to use
