# Vision

Coding agents manage the entire developer environment. The human's role is intent and taste, not maintenance.

## The Dream State

Any stray thought of "this could be better" is instantly translated into a functioning change. You tell an agent what's wrong and it fixes it. You describe what you want and it builds it. No yak shaving. No babysitting. No 3-hour bootstrapping sessions on a new machine because the agent couldn't figure out how to get things running.

The environment sparks joy — it's beautiful and fun to use — but you're not the one polishing it. Agents are.

## The Hard Problem

Developer environments are complex ecosystems with sprawling supply chains and barely any reproducibility. Every tool — tmux, zsh, neovim, mise — has its own bespoke plugin manager. Sometimes there's a lockfile, sometimes there isn't. Cool plugins that make life easy are also the bane of existence: one update and the whole thing's broken. Install on a new machine and the whole thing's broken. Change one file and the whole thing's broken.

These tools were built for humans. Agents need to own them now. The question isn't "how do I make my dotfiles nicer" — it's **how do I make this ecosystem something agents can fully own, operate, and repair without being babysat?**

## What This Is Not

This is a personal developer environment. It exists for one person. It will never be supported, never accept issues, never accept PRs. Others are welcome to learn from it, but it is not a product.
